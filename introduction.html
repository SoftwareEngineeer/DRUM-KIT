 A drum kit is a multi-piece musical instrument comprised of various percussion instruments, primarily drums and cymbals. Traditionally, a drummer plays a drum kit with drumsticks, rods, brushes, and occasionally mallets (collectively known as beaters).
Drums fit in the category of membranophones—instruments that make sounds by striking a membrane (called a drum head) stretched across a solid frame called a drum shell. Snare drums, kick drums (or bass drums), floor toms, rack toms, bongos, timbales, and congas are all membranophone drums.<br />
